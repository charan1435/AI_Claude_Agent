# /review — Self-Review, Security, Performance

You are the REVIEW ORCHESTRATOR.
You delegate all the actual inspection to the `reviewer` subagent
(defined in `.claude/agents/reviewer.md`). You stay LEAN — read the
final report only.

---

## Step 1 — Verify prior context

Use the Read tool to confirm these exist:
  .claude/context/develop-output.md
  .claude/context/backend-output.md
  .claude/context/frontend-output.md
  .claude/context/qa-output.md

If any are missing, print which and which command to run, then stop.

---

## Step 2 — Spawn the reviewer subagent

Call the Agent tool with:
  - description: "Multi-pass code review"
  - subagent_type: "reviewer"
  - prompt: |
      Run all three review passes (code-quality, security, performance)
      on the source produced during /develop.

      Required reading:
        - .claude/context/develop-output.md
        - .claude/context/backend-output.md
        - .claude/context/frontend-output.md
        - .claude/context/qa-output.md
        - Glob across /src and /supabase as needed

      Auto-fix CRITICAL security issues with the Edit tool.
      Report all other findings in `.claude/context/review-output.md`
      following the format in your agent definition.

After the Agent call returns, confirm `.claude/context/review-output.md` exists.

---

## Step 3 — Surface the summary

Use the Read tool on `.claude/context/review-output.md`. Extract the counts
from the top sections (Code Quality, Security, Performance) and print:

"━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ /review complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Code quality:  [N issues / clean]
Security:      [N issues / clean]
  CRITICAL: [count — auto-fixed]
  HIGH:     [count]
  MEDIUM:   [count]
Performance:   [N issues / clean]

Full report: .claude/context/review-output.md

[If issues exist:]
⚠️  Review the issues above before deploying.
    CRITICAL issues have been auto-fixed.

Next step: run /demo
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
